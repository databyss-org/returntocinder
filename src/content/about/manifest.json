"The transvaluation of the philosophical is constant, would be at its heart, would be the othering of its heart—has it ever encountered such a “literal” migration? From Socrates’ mouth to Plato’s page? Migration of letters to other formats, other topographies, to other (improper) grammars. Not only this migration itself as if the new topography or technology is the lesson but the sense that its ability to trans-grammatify affirms, in its appearance, the possibility of doing so again and again, demands it. The Database called Baby–Daddy as a promise of more to come. More databases? More irrecuperable fathers? More pure bastards? Yes, and other things besides. It is absolutely necessary, and this will be developed in what is to follow (inside this book and out), that the event spoken about here not be reduced to the product itself. To a particular ego who decided to “give it his all.” When one inherits words and scratches them back only to ensure the inheritance, there’s little time to make sense of one’s narcissism. I can assure you all, the process of making this Database had nothing to do w/ me, and perhaps not much more to do w/ Derrida; these kinds of reductive classifications need to be warded off from the start, before the start, in order to start—even before detailing the ideational tendencies of restrictively-economizing violences (programs). Nothing to do w/ me and Derrida does not imply some generalizing force beyond singularity. It only means that singularity can never touch its own property. Nor should the term singularity, and this will also require exegesis, reproduce the discrete anthropologism of the word <em>Dasein</em>—singularity is not a new word for the old name “human subject.” Somewhere in the collusion/collision of names: Jake Reeder read Jacques Derrida. There’s an endless, hopelessly dorky play here that I will do my best to keep silent about, though, who would dare deny that syntax demands our fates get written. As I said, this was all about You. The big and the little you, and all that You suffer. I played this video game for You. I wanted to give it all to You. Philosophy, its children, the indestructible justice beyond the law. Plagued by ambition only when constrained by your categorizations, <em>prosthetic usage</em> will bring You beyond the glory of your “I”-ness. <em>Prosthetic usage</em> has such terribly glorious dreams for You. That’s all a spell I’m casting, a price you’ll have to pay for entry. (Make sure you deliberate sufficiently on the desubjectification demanded when the price you pay is your own substitute.)"
