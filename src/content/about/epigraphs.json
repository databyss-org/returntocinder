        "OH p. 104 Kafka, Joyce, Proust, Nietzsche were saved by a handful of readers—but what readers! [re: possible oversight of great media machines of today]",

        "PS p. 328n Nietzsche: “I hate the reading idlers. / He who knoweth the reader, doeth nothing more for the reader. Another century of readers—and spirit itself will stink”",

        "OG p. 84 Leroi-Gourhan invokes notion of <em>program</em>, not a recourse to differentiating man from animal but understood in cybernetic sense (only intelligible via possibility of trace): far beyond “intentional consciousness,” makes <em>grammè</em> appear as such > a “liberation of memory” (reading machines, electronic card indexes) that enlarges differance and possibility of putting in reserve: constitutes/effaces conscious subjectivity, its <em>logos</em>, and its theological attributes<br>pp. 86-7 end of linear writing (epic model) is end of the book: “because we are beginning to write, to write differently, we must reread differently”<br>pp. 133-34 Rousseau & Lévi-Strauss on books piling, filled w/ lies; book of nature: look, don’t read",
        "ATAP p. 87 John Patmos (1: 2–3) “the joys of the reader, of the hearer/of the words of the inspiration/for those who keep what is written/yes, the time approaches”: angelic structure, condition of all marks, time, experience, writing, trace > “apocalyptic” writings: exemplary revelation of this transcendental structure<br>——do not know to whom apocalyptic <em>envoi</em> returns, perhaps not even man is the terminal of this computer w/out end",
        "SPEC pp. 325-26 Derrida explains that a certain passage [on Freud’s indifference to whether Ernst invented game or not] is okay to extract, appears dissociable, a parasite from its immediate context, resonates like sound from elsewhere—murmur<br>p. 344 bind always serves PP, to understand one must hear several voices, speak several languages, & count w/ several generations of computers",
        "H pp. <em>anne</em> 12-4 you should interpret everything I haven’t said (my silences, what’s forbidden)<br>——[re: not knowing one’s own knowledge] leave the keys w/ the other to “unlock words from their enclosure” [AF p. 58 key is a seal]",
        "LOBL p. 161 how do we let a text live? letting someone read is like letting them live [re: Derrida pointing us toward Blanchot]",
        "AF pp. 16-7 the prosthetic, hypomnesic techniques of archive not only place for storing, but also determine structure of the archivable content in its very coming into existence, in its relationship to the future",
        "DS p. 223 mime mimes a kind of writing, is himself written in a  kind of writing, nothing of what is can lie beyond medium/speculum reading-writing > there is 1) writing w/out book, marking tip (<em>la pointe du trait</em>) proceeds w/out past upon virgin sheet 2) infinite number of booklets in other booklets > Mallarmé reads, writes while reading, while reading text written by Mime, who himself reads in order to write<br>p. 283n [re: <em>Les Mots anglais</em>] French grafted onto English—born of an “indissoluble hymen”",
