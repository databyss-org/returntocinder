  <title>Return to Cinder: a database of the work of Jacques Derrida</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Jacques Derrida, perhaps commonly recognized for terms like deconstruction, differance, supplement, parasite, iterability and dissemination, also took the time to write about nearly everything else. This database organizes the breadth of Derrida’s virtuosic reach under 871 motifs.  (If these borders are too limiting, the website also provides the option to search a word or phrase or search a source and/or specific page numbers.) Within each motif you will find quasi-quotations with sufficient referential syntax to help you trace back to the “original” source. The database not only provides a cross-sectional index of terms so that you can find where, for example, Derrida speaks about Justice, Christianity or Heidegger, but each entry gives you the chance to think about the interrupted context you might never retrace. For more information on the abbreviated grammar of each entry, and the edge btwn quotation and paraphrases, please click on the menu bar at the top left corner.">
